## Apple Magic Trackpad Tech Specs
Magic Trackpad gives you a whole new way to control what¡¯s on your Mac desktop computer. When you perform gestures, you actually interact with what¡¯s on your screen. You feel closer to your content, and moving around feels completely natural. Swiping through pages on screen is just like flipping through pages in a magazine, and inertial scrolling senses the momentum in your fingers as you move up and down a page.
